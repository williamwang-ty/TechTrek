# UCB CS61A

## Course Introduction

### What is CS61A?

Exploring the essence of programming and computing through SICP(Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs).

CS61A:

- Uses Python as the primary programming language
- Focuses on teaching fundamental computer science concepts rather than just programming skills
- Covers topics like functions, control structures, higher-order functions, recursion, object-oriented programming, and basic data structures

MIT 6.001 (SICP):

- Traditionally used Scheme (a Lisp dialect) as the primary language
- Focuses on principles of computation and programming language analysis
- Covers topics like abstraction, recursion, interpreters, and symbolic differentiation

In summary, while both courses aim to teach fundamental computer science concepts, CS61A uses a more modern language (Python) and balances theory with practical skills, while MIT's SICP takes a more theoretical, functional programming approach using Scheme.

Both couses are known for being challenging.
