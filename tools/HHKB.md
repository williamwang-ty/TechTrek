## HHKB layout

Compared to traditional keyboards, there are several notable differences:

- The Control key has been placed in the original CAPS LOCK positionï¼›a good news for users who heavily rely on the Control key, such as those using emacs.
- The F1 - F12 keys, as well as the HOME, END, and INS function keys, have been removed.
- The tilde key, originally located to the left of 1, has been moved to the far right. This modification corresponds to the numbers and F1 - F12 keys.
- The Backspace key has been removed and replaced with Delete.
- The arrow keys have been removed.
- The removed keys mentioned above can be restored by using the Fn key in the bottom right corner in combination with another key.

mac layout:
